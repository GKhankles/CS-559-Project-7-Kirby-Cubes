Project: CS 559 Programming Assignment 7

Description: The following project contains 4 adjacent cubes with Kirby's face rotating while the camera also
rotates to create an effect where the cubes appear to be both spinning and moving back and forth (bobbing) from the camera. The shaders and camera components from week 12 demo 2 are used in this submission with some changes.

Instructions:
-The first slider controls the size of the cubes.
-The second sliders controls the y value of the camera's eye (this somewhat impacts the strength of the "bobbing").

Note: koober.png is the image applied to the sides of the cubes. The png file is not needed to run this
submission as the file is retrieved from flickr (I uploaded this png file to my flickr account). It is inside
zip file to be readily available for those looking for the source image.
